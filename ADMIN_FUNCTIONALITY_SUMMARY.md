- ✅ JWT token-based authentication
- ✅ Proper authorization checks on all admin routes

## Testing
- ✅ Database migration tested successfully
- ✅ Admin login functionality verified
- ✅ User management API tested
- ✅ User deletion and status toggle tested
- ✅ Regular user access properly blocked

## Usage Instructions

### For Administrators
1. Register with email `KM@sabosuku.com` to become admin
2. Login to see the admin tab in the extension
3. Click on "管理" tab to access user management
4. View all registered users with their details
5. Toggle user active/inactive status
6. Delete users (except other admins)
7. Refresh the list to see real-time updates

### For Regular Users
- Regular users cannot see the admin tab
- Regular users cannot access user management functions
- All existing functionality remains unchanged
