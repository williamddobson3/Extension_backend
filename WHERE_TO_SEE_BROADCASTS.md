# 📱 Where to See LINE Broadcast Messages

## ❌ **Common Misconception**

**You're looking in the wrong place!**

```
❌ manager.line.biz/account/@568ultax/broadcast
   ↑ This shows MANUAL broadcasts only
   ↑ API broadcasts DON'T appear here
```

---

## ✅ **Where API Broadcasts Actually Appear**

### **Location 1: LINE App (Primary)**

API broadcast messages appear **directly in users' LINE chat**:

```
📱 LINE App
  └── Chats
      └── [Your Bot Name] (@568ultax)
          └── 🔔 Broadcast message appears here!
```

**To see your broadcasts:**
1. Open LINE app on your phone
2. Search for `@568ultax` or your bot name
3. Add as friend (if not already)
4. Check the chat - messages appear here!

---

### **Location 2: LINE Developers Console (Analytics)**

Statistics and delivery info appear in the **Developers Console**:

```
🔗 https://developers.line.biz/console/
  └── Select Channel (2008360670)
      └── Analytics Tab
          └── Message Delivery
              ├── Messages sent: X
              ├── Delivered: X
              └── Failed: X
```

**To check analytics:**
1. Go to: https://developers.line.biz/console/
2. Select your channel (ID: `2008360670`)
3. Click **"Analytics"** tab

4. Is the bot blocked? (check in LINE app)

**Solution:**
```bash
# Run verification script
node verify-line-setup.js

# Check server logs
npm start
# Look for "✅ Channel broadcast sent successfully"

# Test from extension
# Click "LINEテスト" button
```
